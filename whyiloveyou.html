        <h1>So Glad to Have You in My Life</h1>
        <p>
            hi ,well im no hozier but lets see what comes out of me on a late rainy night listening to songs while waiting for your text.
             i want to start off by saying i love you. i love you kshirin shetty , and when i say it it's not really something that i say to get a reaction out of you , its something i say to make sure you know and understand . If im being completely honest its not something im used to saying even now it still takes me back it gives me a rush that holy fuck i love her man , there's been so many occasions where ive just sat down and stared down at an i love you message from you just letting it set in. Ive never felt so strongly about someone ever , and im so glad you make me do i couldn't have asked for a better person nor do i want to ask . im so grateful it's you so grateful man , i love you kshirin shetty and im so glad to have you in my life. 
            i love you more than anything , more than any fight we'll ever have , more than any challenges that come in between , more than any distance , more than any time anything. you're my home away from home and i'll never give up on that or let it go. i have never felt love and comfort the way you make me do. i love everything about you, i love your smile ,i love your hair ,i love the way it smells ,i love when u bite me , i love your tiny little hands , i love your cute nose , i love your voice , i love how caring you are , i love how your inner child comes out around me ,i love the gossip i get , i love listening to you sing random songs , i love being around you , i love the notifications i get from you , i love the fact that i get to have you in my life , i just love you
thank you for being a part of my life , i will forever grateful for every moment i get to spend with you . never in my life would i have guessed id have someone like you with me and i coudlnt have asked for anything else . youre amazing you leave me in awe everytime , you make me fall in love with you everday , you make me wanna be a better person for you , you make me want to believe in a perfect world , you do a lot of things for me without even being aware . you deserve the best there is nothing less , from where i stand idk wether its me or not but nonetheless you deserve it all , all the happiness , all the love , all the care , all the patience , all the understanding , all the waffles,all the princess treatment, all of the nice things in this world
you make my life better just by existing in it , i think you are what holds me together , there's no better feeling in this world than when im with you just having a good time doing nothing . fuck man being in love with you really is a euphoric feeling that i'll never get over , i dont want to either . youre my person my home my everything all i need is you and i can take on anything that life can throw at me. man i love you i love the fact that i love you , just sitting here writing all this is making me realise how much i love you . i love you kshirin shetty and im so glad to have you in my life and ill do everything i can keep it this way and keep you in it .
ive never really understood how you can ever think i'd be done with you , you make me feel all this and so much more i can sit down and pour my heart over a 100 pages believe me i can but it still wouldnt describe what you mean to me and how much i love you. this is something ill never ever give up on , no matter what . ill fight the hardest battles , walk the longest of roads , argue the hardest arguements , explain the worst of situations . youre someone always worth fighting for , im writing all this a few months before your birthday and idk how things are then , but i can guarantee that im still madly in love with you and just being there with you
i didnt really have a plan or structure or anything in my mind i just sat down on a random tuesday at 8:30 and decided to profuse my love for you , and so yes sorry for the spelling mistakes or sentences that dont make sense or any grammatical errors , i wrote down what i felt like as i typed and i dont want to take away that authenticity my going back and redoing any of it
but yeah
i love you
im so glad to have you
and ill do whatever i can to keep you in my life
youre always worth it no matter what or how it is 
i love you
ive never really considered myself to be an expressive person at all in any regards , but the fact that when it comes to you i can just sit down and write paragraphs on paragraphs just yapping about the love i have for you , it makes me feel better more normal
youve changed me in ways i cant describe , youve made me a better person in so many ways , youve made me more sensitive youve made me more expressive , youve made me closer to my mom ffs . because of you ive become a better friend , a better boyfriend , a better son , a better brother , a better student , all this is not even counting all the things that you do for me big or little
you are my whole world kshirin my whole world and im not even worried about that idea , infact there's no else id rather trust with myself , my feelings , my emotions , my secrets , my well being and well my "life" than you 
you are my favorite getaway drug , your face is my favorite view , your voice is my favorite song , your name is my favorite word , next to you is my favorite place ,your hair is my favorite smell , your thoughts are my favorite opinions , your hand my favorite thing to hold , thoughts of you my favorite dreams, my favorite version of myself the reflection of me in your beautiful brown eyes
if all the happy positive wholesome emotions you make me feel and all the memories we have turned into flowers , we'd have a beautiful endless garden of flowers to walk through for the rest of our lives
i have so much more to say but there's not enough words ,enough sentences , enough paragraphs , enough combination or charecters or sounds to truly describe how important you are to me and what you mean to me and how much i love you i just really love you kshirin shetty
 to conclude id like to say i love you , and im here for you whatever wherever whenever , romantically or not idc youre mine and you'll always be looking after you is my responsibilty my job my duty to both myself and you no matter what terms we are on . i love you ill always be here no matter what it is we'll deal with it and fix it . its us it was us it will be us , we'll be fine 


        </p>
        happy kshirin day cutie may all your dreams and wishes come true and i hope for nothing more than being beside you while all that happens , happy birthday my fav flower
        <p>
            Bye bye cutie
