            <div class="description">This is really where it all started, the day I confessed, the day I expressed that I might kinda sorta like you. Man looking back at that, I never thought we'd be here, I have absolutely 0 regrets. I have loved each and every single moment I've gotten to spend with you. I love you, you're my person, kshirin.</div>
